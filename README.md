# EvalCSU-ChatRoom

> Developing ChatRoom with JavaSocket Programming

Geeks of EvalCSU build this basic demo for you to learn and practice JavaSocket in a more standard way.

We hope you can bring your thoughts to life base on this repo rather than CTRL-C/V, since it's just a toy program.

Welcome to light up the stars for [EvalCSU-ChatRoom](https://github.com/EvalCSU/evalcsu-chatroom) and join us at [EvalCSU](https://github.com/Jacob953/evalcsu).

## Feature

1. Java GUI to write the chat room server and client , support for multiple clients to connect to a server . Each client is able to enter an account number. (login)
2. group chat can be implemented (chat logs are displayed on all client interfaces)
3. Complete friend list display on each client.
4. Private chat can be implemented, where users can select a certain other user and send messages individually.
5. The server is able to send system messages in a group, and can force some users to go offline.
6. client's online and offline requirements can be refreshed in real time on top of other clients. (If a friend goes offline, it will be displayed in the friends list)
